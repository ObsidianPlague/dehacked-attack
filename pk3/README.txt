A doom monster randomizer centered around recreating DEHACKED monsters. No, I don't know why either.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED MONSTERS:

STRAIN (1997):
* Subverted Guard: A simple re-skin of the chaingunner.
* Class 2 Imp: Moving much faster than normal imps, these guys also fire on repeat.
* Holobot: A flying drone that fires slow moving revenant missiles. Spawns with cacodemons.
* Invisible Holobot: A spectral variant of the previous monsters. Spawns with pain elementals.
* Doppleganger: A variant of the lost soul, these guys will use an imp's attack before charging.
* Skinless Demon: These guys are colored red and are more durable than normal demons, with the odd amount of exactly 217 health.
* Minister of Hate: A miniture cyberdemon with 300 health, firing singular rockets. Spawns in the revenant slot on rare occasions, and has +NORADIUSDMG.
* Demon Lord: A white hell noble with 1400 health that fires baron balls in mancubus-like spreads. Spawns with barons, and is potentially very deadly.
	* Change: The attack animation is broken in the original STRAIN, causing it to fire faster than intended. This has been corrected.

SCYTHE II (2005):
* Evil Marine: He's an absolute terror to be up against due to his plasma rifle and high movement speed. Spawns in the archvile slot.
	* Change: Drops a Cell instead of a Clip, because DEHACKED doesn't let you change drops but DECORATE does and the inconsistency bothered me.
* (Also from Deus Vult II) Afrit: It's volley of fireballs is very deadly; if you get too close, you're toast. Spawns with barons.
	* Change: As per Deus Vult II, it only has 1500 health, rather than 2500 as in Scythe II.

DEUS VULT II (2008):
* Hell Cleric: Fires imp fireballs rapidly. Spawns commonly with revenants.
	* Change: Has 250 health instead of 200, due to being in a slot with 300 base health.

SCYTHE X (2009):
* Shadow Imp: These mysterious monsters shoot fireballs that summon strange spiritual creatures. Spawns with imps uncommonly, but imps are VERY common.
* Shadow Elemental: A variant of the Pain Elemental; this variant shoots out spirits-summing projectiles fast, and release more spirits when they die.
* Shadow Spirit: The aforementioned spiritual creatures summoned by the Shadow Imp. Does not spawn naturally.

NDCP 2 (2009):
* Slomnibus: A kamikaze cacodemon; this monster flies up to you and then explodes, so keep your distance. Spawns with cacodemons.

JENESIS (2011):
* Mutant Gateway Technician: Possessing a whole 90 HP, these are rather durable variants of the shotgunner.
	* Change: Drops a shotgun (it drops only a clip in the original Jenesis) to maintain consistency with it's weapon of choice.

LUNATIC (2011):
* Plasma Zombie: A Zombie that can fire arachnotron plasma in bursts of three. Spawns with shotgunners.
	* Change: Drops a cell rather than clip for consistency reasons.
* Revenant Missile Zombie: A 75 HP Zombie that fires revenant missiles. Spawns with chaingunners.
	* Change: Drops a single rocket, because why not.

SURVIVE IN HELL (2012):
* Belphegor: A tougher variant of the baron that fires in sets of two fireballs.
* Poison Soul: A small, yet very tanky flying enemy that fires baron fireballs. Spawns in the pain elemental slot.

RESURGENCE (2014):
* Evil Marine (Slower Variant): A variant of the evil marine that moves at less than 20% of the speed. Spawns rarely with revenants, and is still very deadly.

VALIANT (2015):
* Valiant Imp: This variant on the imp shoots faster fireballs in sets of two.
* Valiant Demon: These guys bite MUCH faster than ordinary pinky demons.
* Valiant Spectre: Guess.
* Suicide Bomber: These screaming zombies have but one passion in life, and that is exploding, with the intent of being next to their target. Spawns with pinkies.
* Arachnorb: Floating brain-like creatures that fire red plasma bolts at you. Spawns with Lost Souls, and are a bit skinnier than they were in Valiant.
	* Change: Arachnorbs spawned in the lost soul postion have smaller radius (24 -> 16) so they fit. Other arachnorbs are still full size.
* Pyro Knight: These guys can unless powerful volleys of fireballs; be careful! Thankfully they only have 500 HP. They spawn with Hell Knights.
* Cybruiser: Although they only possess 500 HP, these guys can shoot rockets, and are even immune to splash damage! They spawn with Hell Knights.
* Super Mancubus: Unleashing a mancubus' entire set of six fireballs in a single volley, these guys are tough, especially with their 1000 HP. Spawns with mancubi.
* Valiant Arachnotron: Identical to the normal Arachnotron except for color scheme until you kill it, where it has a 3/4 chance to spawn an arachnorb.
	* Change: In the original valiant, it was 1/2 instead of 3/4. The chance was increased because they're rarer outside of valiant.

ANCIENT ALIENS (2016):
* Stealth Plasma Alien: A 30 HP alien (actually a zombie) with an alien plasma rifle that is nearly invisible until it becomes active. Spawns with shotgunners.
* Alien Guardian: A flying construct that fires salvos of revenant missiles, and can even self destruction. Spawns with cacodemons, though is very fragile.
	* Change: HP upped from 100 to 200.
* Alien Mancubus: A re-skin of the mancubus with a unique look.
* Alien Arachnotron: A re-skin of the arachnotron that fires the purple-ish alien plasma used by the stealth plasma alien.

* Former Captain: These nasty zombies shoot out yellow energy bolts in volleys of five. Spawns with chaingunners.
* Nightmare Demon: These guys are faster than the ordinary pinky demon and have 300 HP.
* Astral Cacodemon: These guys unleash a pair of mancubi fireballs in addition to their cacodemon fireball.
* Annihilator: An upgrade to the cybruiser, these guys have both a rocket launcher and a very powerful chaingun, and spawn with barons.
* Eviternity Arachnotron: A variant of the arachnotron that uses the energy bolts used by the former captain.

PSX DOOM:
* Nightmare Spectre: Faster moving and much tougher variant of the spectre. Has 300 HP and spawns with spectres, naturally.
	* Note: This is not a DEHACKED original, but I felt like giving tribute to a rather different version of Doom and its one original monster.

STRUGGLE: ANTARESIAN LEGACY (2018):
* Antaresia: A serpent-like creature that has a strange firing pattern. Spawns with Hell Knights.
	* Change: Uses the Antaresian Reliquary variant instead of the original, for variety's sake (I liked the red better).
* Antaresia Elite: A more powerful variant of the Antaresia that spawns with the Archvile. Has more HP, less pain chance, and moves much faster.
* Afriest: A flying priest with a powerful triple attack. Spawns with Cacodemons.
* Antaresian Arachnotron: A variant of the arachnotron that moves faster and uses a chaingun instead of a plasma rifle.

ANTARESIAN RELIQUARY (2020):
* Former Ranger: Possessing an energy blaster instead of a rifle, these guys are a bit scarier than the ordinary zombie that they spawn with.
* Plasma Elite: A variant of the former captain up above; these guys shoot blue energy bolts in volleys of three instead, and spawn with the chaingunner.
* Reliquary Arachnotron: A variant of the arachnotron that uses the energy bolts used by the former ranger and plasma elite.

BOSSES:
* Leviathan (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): A fast-moving monster who attacks with an entire mancubus volley simutaneously. Spawns with cyberdemons.
	* Change: Reduced health from 10000 down to 4200.
* Remnant Cardinal (Remnant, 2019): A darker, red flying variant of the cyberdemon that fires rockets much faster in salvos of four.
	* Change: It fires more slowly than in Remnant, and only has 4500 health (it can fly, which is its defensive ability).
* Gridlock Cardinal (Gridlock 64, 2017): A darker, green flying variant of the cyberdemon that cycles between different attacks. If flinched, it retaliates with a rocket.
	* Change: Reduced health from 8000 down to 4800.
* Hell Smith (Survive in Hell, 2012): This guy unleashes a powerful wave of 12 fireballs at once as his attack, and has a LOT of health. He spawns in the cyberdemon slot.
	* Change: Health reduced from 20000 to 8000, because he isn't the final boss of the game anymore.
* Indomitable Mastermind (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): A variant of the spidermastermind that uses both a super-chaingun AND a plasma rifle at the same time.
* Spectral Leviathan (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): Less health and moves slower than the Leviathan, but he's partially invisible. Spawns with Spider Masterminds.
* Angry Spiderdemon (Going Down, 2014): Her brain's red for some reason. Retaliates with fireballs when hurt, and has twice as much health as the ordinary Spider Mastermind.
	* Change: Health reduced from 12000 to 6000.
* Super Archvile (Valiant, 2015): Good luck. This thing attacks with a archvile combo-attack, and can resurrect monsters. It spawns uncommonly with the Spider Mastermind.
	* Change: Health reduced from 7500 to 3750, because it isn't the final boss of the game anymore.
* Remnant Master (Remnant, 2019): This thing looks like a flying mancubus, but it's far nastier. It can fire revenant missiles and uses an archvile attack if flinched.
* Gridlock Cardinal [Phase II]: Same as the Phase I, except if flinched, will spawn monsters icon-of-sin style. Replaces the Gridlock Cardinal if Spawn Targets are present.
	* Change: Reduced health from 6000 down to 4000.
* Leviathan [Summoner Variant]: He CAN be flinched, but doing so will result in him spawning monsters icon-of-sin style. Replaces either Leviathan if Spawn Targets are present.
	* Change: Reduced health from 10000 down to 4200.
* Super Archvile [Summoner Variant]: Summons a swarm of arachnorbs on flinch. Replaces the Super Archvile if Spawn Targets are present.

ICON OF SIN SPECIAL:
All of these are only spawned by the Icon of Sin, and do not spawn naturally:
* Haymaker (UAC Ultra, 2012): A minotaur-like creature with 2500 health that has a cyberdemon's head. It shoots mancubus fireballs from its hammer.
* Cybruiser (Survive in Hell, 2012): This variant has 1300 health, and fires rockets in sets of two.

FINAL BOSSES (enabled by CVar and then selected in place of Icon of Sin):
* Hell Smith (Survive in Hell): More aggressive than his ordinary counterpart. With his full 20000 health, he's is hard to take down, and spawns AFTER a large army of other monsters.
* Spider Mastermind (Going Down): A totally ordinary spider mastermind with nothing weird about it (ha, yeah right). Spawns with some zombies, imps, demons and revenants.
* Super Archvile (Valiant): Spawns with a swarm of arachnorbs. Has 7500 health, and spawns revenants and pyro-knights if fliched, adding deadlier monsters if flinched more than four times.
* Gridlock Cardinal [Final Boss Form] (Gridlock 64): This monstrosity has both phases and moves faster, and in phase two it even now has the ability to teleport. Good luck.
* Archangelus (Eviternity): Descending from the realm opposite Hell, this guy is insane. One might wish for good luck; but truth be told, it won't save you.
* The Inquisitor (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy): This guy will unleash an absolute firestorm whenever you're in his line of sight, and spawns with a swarm of Afriests.
