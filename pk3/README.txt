A doom monster randomizer centered around recreating DEHACKED monsters. No, I don't know why either.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED MONSTERS:

SCYTHE II:
* Evil Marine: Moves slower than in Scythe 2 for balance reasons; even still, he's an absolute terror to be up against. Spawns in the arachnotron slot.
* (Also from Deus Vult II) Afrit: Only possessing 1500 health rather than 2500, it's volley of fireballs is still very deadly. Spawns with barons uncommonly.

DEUS VULT II:
* Hell Cleric: Fires imp fireballs rapidly. Spawns with revenants, and has 300 health (up from the original 200) to make up for the slot discrepency.

SCYTHE X:
* Shadow Imp: These mysterious monsters shoot fireballs that summon these deadly, but weak spiritual creatures. Spawns with imps uncommonly, but imps are VERY common.
* Shadow Elemental: Spawns with Pain Elementals; these variants shoot out spirits lightning quick, and release more when they die.
* Shadow Spirit: The aforementioned spiritual creatures summoned by the Shadow Imp.

JENESIS
* Mutant Gateway Technician: Possessing a whole 90 HP, these are rather durable variants of the shotgunner.

LUNATIC
* Plasma Zombie: A Zombie that can fire arachnotron plasma in bursts of three. Spawns with shotgunners.
* Revenant Missile Zombie: A 75 HP Zombie that fires revenant missiles. Spawns with chaingunners.

VALIANT:
* Valiant Imp: This variant on the imp shoots faster fireballs in sets of two.
* Valiant Demon: These guys bite MUCH faster than ordinary pinky demons.
* Valiant Spectre: Guess.
* Arachnorb: Floating brain-like creatures that fire red plasma bolts at you. Spawns with Lost Souls, and are a bit skinnier than they were in Valiant.
* Pyro Knight: These guys can unless powerful volleys of fireballs; be careful! Thankfully they only have 500 HP, but they spawns with the Hell Knights.
* Cybruiser: Although they only possess 500 HP, these guys can shoot rockets, and are even immune to splash damage! Spawns with Hell Knights uncommonly.
* Super Mancubus: Unleashing a mancubus' entire set of six fireballs in a single volley, these guys are tough, especially with their 1000 HP. Spawns with mancubi uncommonly.
* Valiant Arachnotron: Identical to the normal Arachnotron except for color scheme until you kill it, where it has a 50% chance to spawn an arachnorb.

EVITERNITY:
* Former Captain: These nasty zombies shoot out yellow energy bolts in volleys of five. Spawns with chaingunners.
* Nightmare Demon: These guys are faster than the ordinary pinky demon and have 300 HP.
* Astral Cacodemon: These guys unleash a pair of mancubi fireballs in addition to their cacodemon fireball.
* Annihilator: An upgrade to the cybruiser, these guys have both a rocket launcher and a very powerful chaingun.

PSX DOOM:
* Nightmare Spectre: Faster moving and much tougher variant of the spectre. Has 300 HP and spawns with spectres, naturally.

ANTARESIAN LEGACY/RELIQUARY:
* Former Ranger: Possessing an energy blaster instead of a rifle, these guys are a bit scarier than the ordinary zombie that they spawn with.
* Plasma Elite: A variant of the former captain up above; these guys shoot blue energy bolts in volleys of three instead.
* Antaresian Elite: A serpent-like creature that has a strange firing pattern. Spawns with archviles.

BOSSES:
* Gridlock Cardinal (Gridlock 64): A darker, flying variant of the cyberdemon that cycles between different monster attacks. If flinched, it retaliates with a rocket.
* Avatar of Hell (Survive in Hell): This guy unleashes a powerful wave of 12 fireballs at once as his attack, and has a lot of health. He spawns in the cyberdemon slot.
* Angry Spiderdemon (Going Down): Her brain's red for some reason. Guess you made her REALLY mad at you. Retaliates with fireballs when hurt, and has more health.
* Super Archvile (Valiant): Good luck. You'll need it if this M-F-er spawns.
