Counterpart to Dehacked Attack, consisting of custom weapons rather than monsters.

You can use the options in the menu to control which WADs' weapons sets are enabled or disabled in the randomizer,
or whether or not to spawn weapons in a purely class-based manner. sv_weaponstay only respects the class-based weaponset.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED WEAPONS:

STRAIN (Alpha Dog Alliance, 1997):
* DOUBLE FIST: Punches twice. Not much else to say here.
* SAWED-OFF: A variant of the shotgun that fires ever-so-slightly faster.
* NFG: Sharing the slot with the plasma rifle, this powerful weapon does 140% more damage than the plasma rifle (5 base damage to 12), but uses NFG Batteries for ammo.
	* Change: Maximum Ammo doubled from 50/100 to 100/200, and pickups are upped from 3/15 to 6/30.
* PSYCHIC BLASTER: Uses three rockets a shot to fire partially invisible projectiles with insane direct hit damage.

DEUS VULT II (Huy Pham, 2008):
* DUAL PISTOLS: Having much more stopping power than the singular pistol, this weapon can actually be helpful sometimes.
* SAURON'S GAUNTLET: At sufficiently close range, you are now emperor palpatine. Almost any singular target too close to these will get shredded very quickly.

VALIANT (skillsaw, 2015):
* SUPER PISTOL: Fires significantly faster than the normal pistol
* SUPER CHAINGUN: 'You can't just make the chaingun fire twice as fast!' 'Ha ha, super chaingun go brrrrr'

MASKIM XUL (Obsidian, 2018):
* DUAL PISTOLS: They're back! Though they have a different firing sound than DV2's.
* HAND OF AFRIT: A magical equivalent to the rocket launcher that fires explosive comets with far higher radius damage. Uses Demon Hearts for ammo.
* JACK BOX: Fires a mysterious jack-in-the-box that lands in front of the shooter's feet. A few seconds later, it explodes for over 1000 damage.
* GRIMOIRE EXCIDIUM: Fires TWO waves of BFG tracers per shot, but uses a random amount of the players health for ammo. Be careful!

STRUGGLE: ANTARESIAN LEGACY (antares, 2018):
* HAMMER: This melee weapon is still fairly useless, but at least it hits for more damage than the normal fist. It still works with Berserk, however!
* DRILL MACHINE: Significantly faster than the chainsaw, this thing rips into demon flesh surprisingly effectively.
* PISTOL: Antaresian Legacy's pistol fires faster and in rounds of two bullets at once, making it significantly stronger.
* SHOTGUN: It looks fancy, but it's really just a slightly faster version of the normal shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Loaded with blue shells, otherwise this weapon is identical to the normal super shotgun.
* DUAL PISTOLS: It turns out when you start with an already strong pistol, dual-wielding it makes the weapon REALLY good.
* GRENADE LAUNCHER: It fires 75% slower than the normal rocket launcher, but it does FAR higher single-target damage per missile.
* ASSAULT RIFLE: Despite being what looks like a bullet weapon, it's very close to the plasma rifle in usage. Uses .223 caliber magazines for ammo.
* LEICHENFAUST: And you thought the BFG 9000 was crazy. This uses rocket ammo, and against non-splash immune enemies it puts the BFG 9000 to shame.

ANTARESIAN RELIQUARY (antares, 2020):
* FIST: The Antaresian Reliquary marine can punch much harder than the ordinary marine.
* CHAINSAW: slashes at a slightly increased speed compared to the vanilla chainsaw, but it's not as significant as other changes.
* MACHINEGUN: Rather than start with a pistol, the Antaresian Reliquary marine starts with a fairly useful machine gun.
* SHOTGUN: Fires ever so slightly faster, compared to the ordinary doom shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Autoloading shells means you can speedload this wonderful weapon even faster.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Overall slightly buffed compared to the normal rocket launcher.
* PLASMA RIFLE: The damage matches STRAIN's NFG, but it fires slower. Uses Antaresian Cells, which are given in quantities of 16 (cell)/80 (cell pack)
* BFG 9000: Uses 30 Antaresian Cells instead of 40 ordinary energy cells. The projectile does slightly less damage than the ordinary BFG.
